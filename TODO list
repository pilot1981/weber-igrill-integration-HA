- #!/usr/bin/env python in monitor.py to #!/usr/bin/env python3
- ADDRESS and mqtt_server in monitor_igrill_v2.py
- mqtt.yaml to show my host IP and port for my mqtt server
- 3 shouldnâ€™t have been nexessary, I think, because the mqtt info is hardcoded in the file monitor_igrill_v2.py anyway


I also modified the monitor_igrillv2.py like this and made the file executable:


import json
import time
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

from igrill import IGrillV2Peripheral

ADDRESS = 'RE:AL:MA:CD'
mqtt_server = "mqtt"
